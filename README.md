## Description
For this assignment we were given starter code and had to create full offline functionality. Not only that, but we had to retain all offline activity and add it to our live database when connectivity is restored. This involved adding a webmanifest, service-worker, and indexedDB functionality. This assignment was particularly tricky because the instructions were very vague.
